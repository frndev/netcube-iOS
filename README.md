# Netcube

This project has been created for having participated in [Yuzz JÃ³venes con Ideas](http://yuzz.org.es/). This is an iOS application that can manage a switch and a plug wherever it is through Wi-Fi. For this reason, the app is useless without these devices, so if you need to know more about how and why I implemented it, please contact me.
